## Pre-requisites:

* Knowledge about system calls, How to read and understand ‘man pages’.
* Command line arguments, File operation system calls (open, read, write, close ..etc)
* Working of dup system calls.
## Objective:
To understand and implement using basic system calls.

## Requirements:

Using dup or dup2 redirect printf out to a given file instead of printing to stdout.

Pass the file name using command-line arguments.

Try using both system calls (dup and dup2).

## Sample Execution:
./dup_dup2 f1.txt

Print this message into STDOUT

Note : printf() should be diverted on file and one on STDOUT
